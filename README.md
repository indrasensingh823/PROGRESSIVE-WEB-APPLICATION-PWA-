Welcome to the **Progressive Web Application (PWA) E-Commerce Website** — a modern, lightweight, and responsive shopping web app developed as part of an internship assignment. This project demonstrates the core capabilities of PWA including offline functionality, installability, and push notifications using Service Workers, Cache API, and manifest configuration. 

The platform dynamically displays products from a JSON file and works seamlessly across devices — whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop. Users can browse products, view details, and simulate cart functionality even in offline mode. The app is designed to be added to a user's home screen and provides a near-native experience.

Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases the potential of web technologies in delivering reliable and engaging user experiences. With focus on performance and usability, this app is a great starting point for anyone interested in building PWAs and understanding modern front-end practices in e-commerce.
